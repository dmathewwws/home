# Recipes

A Local First Auth mini app living at `apps/recipes` in this workspace, served under
`/recipes/` on the shared domain. Scaffolded from `templates/mini-app-starter` by
`pnpm new-app` — signup/login, REST API, SQLite (D1), and real-time WebSocket updates
are already wired.

## Everyday commands

From this directory (`apps/recipes`):

```bash
pnpm dev                     # dev servers (real QR-code sign-in)
pnpm dev:simulator           # …with a fake test user — no phone needed
pnpm build                   # build shared, then client
pnpm db:generate-migrations  # regenerate migrations after editing server/src/db/schema.ts
pnpm db:run-migrations       # apply migrations to the local D1
```

The local D1 needs no Cloudflare account (`database_id = "local"`); `pnpm new-app`
already ran the initial migrations.

## Building features

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the architecture (auth, database, WebSockets, API) and
[`../../docs/mini-app-examples.md`](../../docs/mini-app-examples.md) for reference apps
to learn patterns from.

## Deploy

```bash
# pnpm new-app already created .env from apps/console's deploy creds when they
# existed; otherwise: cp .env.example .env, fill in CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and use
# the SAME ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN as apps/console (one token per Cloudflare account)
pnpm exec alchemy configure  # one-time Cloudflare API token setup (alchemy is a devDep)
pnpm run deploy:cloudflare
```

Routes on the shared domain attach automatically once `ALLOWED_PRODUCTION_ORIGIN` in
`alchemy.run.ts` is your real domain — edit the literal in this app's `alchemy.run.ts`
(and in `templates/mini-app-starter/alchemy.run.ts` so future apps inherit it).

After the first deploy, register the app with the host console (landing-grid card +
admin bindings): follow **"Register with the host console"** in
[`../console/docs/hosting-a-mini-app.md`](../console/docs/hosting-a-mini-app.md).

## Troubleshooting

- The worker serves under the subpath — in dev the API is at
  `http://localhost:<worker-port>/recipes/api`, not `/api` (Hono `basePath`).
- Port already in use: see
  [`../../docs/port-troubleshooting.md`](../../docs/port-troubleshooting.md).
